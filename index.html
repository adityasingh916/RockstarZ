                <h3>INTO THE META GAME</h3>
                <p>In the neon-drenched shadows of Dark-City, your flesh is a liability. Left for dead after a data-heist went sideways, your only escape is to jack into the digital frontier known as the Meta. Here, data is the only currency that matters, and your mind is the ultimate weapon. To survive, you must hunt for cutting-edge cybernetics, slot illegal "wetware," and rewrite the very code of the system that left you behind. Forget the body you were born with—it's time to upload, upgrade, and become the urban legend they were foolish enough to create. </p>

                <h3>ABOUT GAME</h3>
                <p>The future is chrome, and humanity is just hardware. In RockstarZ, you are a cyber-jockey fresh off a failed data-heist, left for dead in the gutters of Dark-City. To survive, you'll need to rebuild yourself—literally. Hunt for cutting-edge cybernetics, slot illegal bio-enhancements, and upgrade your "wetware" to become the ultimate urban weapon. In a world where flesh is a liability, how much of your humanity will you sacrifice to get to the top?</p>

                <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
                <p>TMy name is Aditya Dhanraj, and I'm the mind behind this project. As a long-time fan of the cyberpunk genre, from its classic literature to its modern-day epics, I wanted to create a space that felt truly immersive. This website began as a passion project to blend my skills in web development with my love for deep, atmospheric world-building. RockstarZ is my tribute to the genre—a world I hope you get as lost in as I did while building it.</p></p>
