# RockstarZ
The future is chrome, and humanity is just hardware. In RockstarZ, you are a cyber-jockey fresh off a failed data-heist, left for dead in the gutters of Dark-City. To survive, you'll need to rebuild yourself—literally. Hunt for cutting-edge cybernetics, slot illegal bio-enhancements, and upgrade your "wetware" to become the ultimate urban weapon.
